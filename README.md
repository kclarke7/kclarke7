<h2>📝 What I'm Learning</h2>
<h3>🏫 Academic Courses</h3>
<p>CSC Courses I have taken/what I am currently taking</p>

  * COMP 110 - An introduction to computational problem solving using the Python programming language. Students will learn the basic elements of programming (e.g. conditionals, loops, inputs/outputs), modular program design, and the basics of data abstraction through object-oriented programming.
  * CSC 170 and 170L - Introduction to programming and problem solving in an object-oriented language with emphasis on basic programming constructs, arrays, debugging, software engineering practices, and the fundamentals of file handling. The focus of this course is to provide further support in learning C++ programming language syntax, semantics, and developing students' abilities to apply the knowledge in transforming algorithms into C++ code. (170L) This course is a supplementary course to CSC 170. It is structured as a closed computer laboratory where students complete specific programming tasks within a fixed time.
  * CSC 260 and 260L - Introduction to data structures, algorithms and building objects. Topics include linked lists, stacks and queues, recursion, and binary trees. (260L) Supplementary course to CSC 260 structured as a closed computer laboratory to complete specific programming tasks within a fixed time.
  * CSC Unix and C Programming - An introduction to C programming in a UNIX environment. Course content includes the UNIX command interpreter Shell; the use of Shell scripts to create powerful tools and applications; and the development of application and systems programs using C.
  * CSC 372 Data Structures - Analysis of data structures and algorithms using C++ as the implementation language. Detailed examination of lists, heaps, trees, graphs, file structures, and the use of formal methods with emphasis on the development and analysis of efficient algorithms.
<h3>😄 In My Free Time</h3>
<p>I am teaching myself Excel and SQL for data analytics. I will soon be working on a project that combines those skills
with my proficiency in Python. I enjoy project-based learning so I am working on two full-stack projects: one that will be built as a web interface, 
and the other that will be a mobile application. I want to gain start-to-finish experience with developing both the 
front-end and back-end of different types of projects while also utilizing frameworks I haven't worked with before. 
As I continue to develop these softwares, their repositories will be linked here, so you can follow along, see how far I've come, or leave feedback that will aid in my growth!</p> 

Finish products will also be linked in [My Portfolio](https://kclarke7.github.io/kyla-clarke-portfolio/).
