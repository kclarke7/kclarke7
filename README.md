<h2>My interests</h2>
<p>I am passionate about problem-solving and design. I am very open to exploring various industries including, but not limited to BioTech, FinTech, Fashion Tech, and GovCon. </p>
<h2>📝 What I'm Learning</h2>
<h3>🏫 Academic Courses</h3>
<p>CSC Courses I have taken/what I am currently taking</p>

  * COMP 110 - An introduction to computational problem solving using the Python programming language. Students will learn the basic elements of programming (e.g. conditionals, loops, inputs/outputs), modular program design, and the basics of data abstraction through object-oriented programming.
  * CSC 170 and 170L - Introduction to programming and problem-solving in an object-oriented language with emphasis on basic programming constructs, arrays, debugging, software engineering practices, and the fundamentals of file handling. The focus of this course is to provide further support in learning C++ programming language syntax, semantics, and developing students' abilities to apply the knowledge in transforming algorithms into C++ code. (170L) This course is a supplementary course to CSC 170. It is structured as a closed computer laboratory where students complete specific programming tasks within a fixed time.
  * CSC 260 and 260L - Introduction to data structures, algorithms, and building objects. Topics include linked lists, stacks and queues, recursion, and binary trees. (260L) Supplementary course to CSC 260 structured as a closed computer laboratory to complete specific programming tasks within a fixed time.
  * CSC Unix and C Programming - An introduction to C programming in a UNIX environment. Course content includes the UNIX command interpreter Shell; the use of Shell scripts to create powerful tools and applications; and the development of application and systems programs using C.
  * CSC 372 Data Structures - Analysis of data structures and algorithms using C++ as the implementation language. Detailed examination of lists, heaps, trees, graphs, file structures, and the use of formal methods with emphasis on the development and analysis of efficient algorithms.
<h3>😄 In My Free Time</h3>
<p>I'm currently teaching myself Excel and SQL to strengthen my skills in data analytics. Soon, I’ll be working on a project that combines those tools with my proficiency in Python. Since I enjoy project-based learning, I'm also building two full-stack applications—one as a web interface and the other as a mobile app. My goal is to gain hands-on, start-to-finish experience with both front-end and back-end development while exploring frameworks that are new to me.

As I continue building these projects, I’ll link their repositories here so you can follow my progress, see how far I’ve come, and even share feedback that can support my growth!</p> 

Finish products will also be linked in [My Portfolio](https://kclarke7.github.io/kyla-clarke-portfolio/).

<h2>Future Plans</h2>
<p>I am currently seeking an internship opportunity that will aid in connecting my academic background to real-world application, enhance my professional development, and foster an environment of hands-on learning. I am a lifelong learner who seeks to combine creativity and technical aptitude to help provide solutions to any problem and look forward to partnering with a company that will aid in my continued growth. </p>
